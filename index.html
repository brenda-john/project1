        <p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
  All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
        And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! <br>
        The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! <br>
  Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun <br>
        The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>He took his vorpal sword in hand; <br>
        Long time the manxome foe he sought— <br>
  So rested he by the Tumtum tree <br>
        And stood awhile in thought.</p>
  <br>
  <p>And, as in uffish thought he stood, <br>
        The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br> 
  Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, <br>
        And burbled as it came!</p>
  <br>
  <p>One, two! One, two! And through and through <br>
        The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! <br>
  He left it dead, and with its head <br>
        He went galumphing back.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? <br>
        Come to my arms, my beamish boy! <br>
  O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” <br>
        He chortled in his joy.</p>
  <br>
  <p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br>
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
  All mimsy were the borogoves, <br>
        And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
